# Authentication

## Summary

In this project, we built an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

- This is the second application for the Microverse Ruby on Rails curriculum module
- [Project Specs](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication)

### In this project we create a simple Post with Authentication feature to learn the basics of Ruby on Rails including

- Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)
- Data Structures & Relationships
- Routing
- Migrations
- Views with forms, partials, and helpers
- RESTful design
- Adding gems for extra features
- Authentication
