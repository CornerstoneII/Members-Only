## Ruby on Rails

Part of the reason Ruby on Rails became popular quickly is that it takes a lot of the hard work off your hands, and that‚Äôs especially true in starting up a project. Rails practices the idea of "sensible defaults" and will, with one command, create a working application ready for your customization.

- This is the second application for the Microverse Ruby on Rails curriculum module
